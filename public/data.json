      "description": "Centralized sequencers may give rollup users a pre-confirmation that their transaction will eventually be included in the finalized rollup state. These pre-confirmations can be trusted via a combination of reputation, security bonds, and/or fraud proofs. With Espresso's HotShot consensus, clients can opt for stronger confirmations in just seconds. As long as no adversary controls more than one third of the HotShot stake, the client's transaction can never be rolled back. This is especially useful for bridging, as bridges are sensitive to reorgs in the source chain.",
